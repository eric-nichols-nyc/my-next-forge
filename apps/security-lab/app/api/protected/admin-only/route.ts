/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SECURITY LAB: Role-Based Authorization Example
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This endpoint demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC).
 * It requires not just authentication, but also the "admin" role.
 *
 * KEY INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION vs AUTHORIZATION:
 * - Authentication = "Are you logged in?" (middleware checks JWT)
 * - Authorization = "Do you have permission?" (route checks role)
 *
 * LAYERS OF SECURITY:
 * 1. Middleware: Verifies JWT token (authentication)
 * 2. Route handler: Checks user role (authorization)
 * 3. Business logic: Validates specific permissions if needed
 *
 * WHY CHECK ROLES IN ROUTE, NOT JUST MIDDLEWARE?
 * - Middleware can check roles, but routes need flexibility
 * - Some routes might allow multiple roles
 * - Some routes need complex permission logic
 * - Business rules might depend on context (e.g., user owns resource)
 *
 * DEFENSE IN DEPTH:
 * - Middleware blocks invalid tokens (first layer)
 * - Route checks role (second layer)
 * - Database queries filter by user ID/role (third layer)
 * - Multiple layers = harder to bypass
 *
 * TEST THIS:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Step 1: Login as regular user
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/login \
 *     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *     -d '{"email":"user@test.com","password":"user123"}' \
 *     -c cookies.txt
 *
 * Step 2: Try to access admin route (fails with 403)
 *   curl http://localhost:3008/api/protected/admin-only -b cookies.txt
 *
 * Step 3: Login as admin
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/login \
 *     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *     -d '{"email":"admin@test.com","password":"admin123"}' \
 *     -c cookies.txt
 *
 * Step 4: Access admin route (succeeds)
 *   curl http://localhost:3008/api/protected/admin-only -b cookies.txt
